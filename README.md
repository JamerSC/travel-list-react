- Building a Form and Handling Submissions
- Controlled Elements (Technic) working with Form, this is not controlled by the DOM but by the REACT APP itself.

- State vs. Props

1. State
   Internal data, owned by component
   Component "Memory"
   Updating state causes component to re-render
   Used to make components interactive
2. Props
   External data, owned by parent component
   Similar to fxn parameter
   Read-Only
   Receiving new props causes component to re-render. Usually when the parents state has been updated.
